                    <h1>How our process works CONNECT & DATA GATHERING</h1>
                    <p>First, you select a package or bundle and submit your interest in joining with our online coaching subscription service.</p>
                    <p>We contact you through whatsapp and start the set up process and also get your payment processed.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Apart from the basic data gathering, we require you to submit;</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>A physical assessment video using the following reference material</li>
                            <li>Your current training plan and cardio routine ( if any )</li>
                            <li>Your current calorie intake and protein intake. If you do not know your intakes, share with us pictures of the food & drinks you consume for a 24 hour period.</li>


                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>Once the data is gathered, we start developing your starter plan. This will usually take 48 hours.</p>
                    <h1>STARTER WEEK</h1>
                    <p>Once built and handed over, you will review the plan and list down your questions and clarifications. Once your concerns have been addressed you can start following the plan.</p>
                    <p>During the first week of following the plan, all clients are expected to submit a recording of each of the exercises performed using a managable weight for the given set-rep scheme. Only once the technique is cleared are you allowed to use more challenging weights.</p>
                    <p>Based on reviewing those videos, your coach will further customize the plan if necessary to better fit your fitness level.</p>
                    <p>Meal plan wise, we start you off with minimum of 10 meal options. If you are a vegan living in Sri Lanka, you will get less options in general because of the difficulty of finding variety.</p>
                    <p>If you face any issues or difficulties or require different meal options, this too shall be addressed during the starter week.</p>

                    <h1>THE WEEKS THAT FOLLOW</h1>

                    <p>Once the starter week is done, further customisations will only be done during assessments. Your assessments are done based on the package you have selected.</p>

                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Package 1: weekly</li>
                            <li>Package 2: every two weeks</li>
                            <li>Package 3: every three weeks</li>
                            <li>Package 4: every four weeks.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h1>Progress updates</h1>
                        <p>We expect all clients to submit a progress update every week describing how well or poorly they followed the plan. A form will be provided on the plan for this purpose.</p>


                    </div>

                    <h1>Follow ups</h1>
                    <p>Based on the package subscibed to, we will send you a reminder to submit progress updates. These progress updates are very important for future plan update.</p>


                    <h1>Logging your training stats</h1>
                    <p>We expect all clients to journal/log their lifting data as they follow the plan. This data is very important for future training plan updates.</p>

                    <h1>Answering your questions</h1>
                    <p>There will be questions that pop up as you follow the plan. Those questions must be submitted via whatsapp text messages or voice notes. They will be addressed withiin 48-72 hours unless you have purchased a “24 hour reply gaurantee”. In which case, your questions will be answered within 24 hours.</p>

                    <h1>Voice calls</h1>
                    <p>All voice calls must be scheduled before hand. We offer them to all clients, on all packages.</p>
